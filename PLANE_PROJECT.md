# Plane Project
## Epic Story
- As a user I want a system where a customer can buy a ticket for a plane
- See how many seats are available
- If seat is sold, this shows up (- from total number of seats)

## User story
- As an airport assistance I want to be able to create a passenger with a name and Passport number so that I can add
 them to the flight
- As an airport assistant I want to be able to create flight_trip with specific destination
- As an airport assistant I want to be able to assign and or change a plane to my flight_trip, input my password, so
 I can handle the problem
- As an airport assistant I want to be able to add passengers to flight_trip so that I can sell the tickets to them
- As an airport assistant I want to be able to generate a flight_attendees_list_report that lists passenger's names
  and passports so that I can check their identity
